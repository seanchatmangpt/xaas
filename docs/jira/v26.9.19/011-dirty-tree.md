# xaas: commit or clean uncommitted changes

- Standing: OPEN
- Created: 2026-09-19 (v26.9.19 gh survey wave)
- Source: working tree dirty at survey time
- Evidence: `git status --porcelain` → 3 path(s) (tracked-modified: 0, untracked: 3); sample: ?? tmp_out/failover-verify-epoch1/;?? tmp_out/repro2-b7d87048/;

## Work to complete
- For the 3 untracked path(s): add intentional files to git and commit; gitignore or delete build artifacts/temp files.
- Note: this survey's ticket files under docs/jira/v26.9.19/ are intentionally uncommitted; include or exclude them deliberately in the commit plan.

## Acceptance
- `git status --porcelain` is clean (except items deliberately deferred and recorded here).

## History
- 2026-09-19 | OPEN | survey found dirty tree | 3 paths (T0/U3) | commit/clean pending
